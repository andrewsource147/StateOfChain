<h3>General Ideals</h3>
<p>
To be given with a high quality and satisfying answer, the questioner must deposit an adequate amount of fund into their account.
While waiting for some answers to come, that mount will be locked for a certain period of time (E.x. 24h).
During that time, questioner can accept any answer that make the most sence out of their question and release the locked fund to the owner of that answer.
Any voters vote for that answer before accepted will be rewarded a small portion of question's bounty into their account.
If the questioner does not accept any answers, an answer with the highest votes following the fastest one will be marked as accepted automatically.
